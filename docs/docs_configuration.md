# Configuration

Here you would find a long description, maybe the description in [example file](https://chaos.expert/FreifunkBremen/yanic/blob/master/config_example.toml) are enough for you.

The config file for Yanic written in "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language." [syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml).
(if you need somethink multiple times, checkout out the [[array of table]] section)

## [respondd]
{% method %}
Group for configuration of respondd request.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[respondd]
enable           = true
# synchronize    = "1m"
collect_interval = "1m"

#[respondd.sites.example]
#domains            = ["city"]

[[respondd.interfaces]]
ifname             = "br-ffhb"
#ip_address        = "fe80::..."
#send_no_request   = false
#multicast_address = "ff02::2:1001"
#port              = 10001
```
{% endmethod %}


### enable
{% method %}
Enable request and collection of data per respondd requests
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
enable = true
```
{% endmethod %}


### synchronize
{% method %}
Delay startup until a multiple of the period since zero time
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
synchronize      = "1m"
```
{% endmethod %}


### collect_interval
{% method %}
How often send request per respondd.

It will send UDP packets with multicast address `ff02::2:1001` and port `1001`.
If a node does not answer after the half time, it will request with the last know address under the port `1001`.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
collect_interval = "1m"
```
{% endmethod %}


### [respondd.sites.example]
{% method %}

```
{% endmethod %}


### [[respondd.interfaces]]
{% method %}

It is possible to have multiple interfaces, just add this group again with new parameters (see toml [[array of table]]).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[[respondd.interfaces]]
ifname             = "br-ffhb"
#ip_address        = "fe80::..."
#send_no_request   = false

{% method %}
ip address is the own address which is used for sending.
If not set or set with empty string it will take an address of ifname.
(If `multicast_address` is not set the link local address otherwise a global unicast address)
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
ip_address          = "fe80::..."
```
{% endmethod %}

{% endmethod %}

### multicast_address
{% method %}

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
multicast_address    = "ff02::2:1001"
```
{% endmethod %}

### port
{% method %}

port              = 10001
```
{% endmethod %}

Every database type has his own configuration under `database.connection`.
It is possible to have multiple connections for one type of database, just add this group again with new parameters (see toml [[array of table]]).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
[[database.connection.example]]
enable = true
```
{% endmethod %}


### enable

- model: store the count of nodes tagged with hardware model
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
enable   = false
address  = "http://localhost:8086"
database = "ffhb"
username = ""
password = ""
insecure_skip_verify = false
[database.connection.influxdb.tags]
tagname1 = "tagvalue 1"
system   = "productive"
site     = "ffhb"
```
{% endmethod %}

password = ""
```
{% endmethod %}

Skip insecure verify for self-signed certificates.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
insecure_skip_verify = true
```
{% endmethod %}


### [database.connection.influxdb.tags]
{% method %}
You could set manuelle tags with inserting into a influxdb.
Useful if you want to identify the yanic instance when you use multiple own on the same influxdb (e.g. multisites).

Warning:
Tags used by Yanic would override the tags from this config (e.g. `nodeid`, `hostname`, `owner`, `model`, `firmware_base`, `firmware_release`, `frequency11g`, `frequency11a`).
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
tagname1 = "tagvalue 1s"

### address
{% method %}

{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
address = "localhost:2003"
```
{% endmethod %}


### prefix
{% method %}
Graphite is replacing every "." in the metric name with a slash "/" and uses
that for the file system hierarchy it generates. it is recommended to at least
move the metrics out of the root namespace (that would be the empty prefix).
If you only intend to run one community and only freifunk on your graphite node
then the prefix can be set to anything (including the empty string) since you
probably wont care much about "polluting" the namespace.
{% sample lang="toml" %}
```toml
prefix = "freifunk"
```
{% endmethod %}



## [[database.connection.respondd]]
